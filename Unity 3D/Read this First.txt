Basically you are a criminal(player) who gets chased down by police cars.

The police cars successfully found the player's car using ray-casting geometric algorithm.

I also added some cars which can find roads on its own and drive accordingly.
This was possible through Ml-agents training in python's virtual environment
which can be connected with unity game engine. 

And as far as i know all programming in unity is done through C#. I did
exactly that.

Heres is the drive link for the execution file of the game:

Happy Gaming!!!
